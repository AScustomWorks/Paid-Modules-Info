# Paid Modules Info

Hopefullly you won't need to, but if you find any issue with my paid modules, you can open a new issue here.

Please search in open and closed issues first, if you don't find what you are looking for, just open a new issue and I'll look into it for sure.

And as usual: state your plugin version, rack version and platform, thanks!
